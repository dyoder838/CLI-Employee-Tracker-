 ## Description
        
This project uses inquirer and MySQL to create and manage a database of employees. I created it to better understand MySQL database calls. With it, I can create departments, employee roles, and employees. I can also promote or demote an employee, and I can view all current employees and their roles.

## Usage 

[Tutorial Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17mi2eK4PNBgp-J0eFgeNb6_cVKwJyasP/view)     
Type npm start into your CLI and follow the prompts. Note: if you decide to clear the database I suggest start the database building from the department first, then role, then employee. they are all reliant on each other.
